An Operating System is responsible for managing resources. A computer without an operating system can only run one program from boot-up to shut down. There are some advantages to running code like this, such as having no overhead, allowing a single program to access all the resources on a system. However, typically, our operating systems have multiple users, or a single user who wants to use the computer as a workstation running multiple programs.

The operating system allows us to run multiple programs by running as a supervisor and allocating resources for programs that make requests to it. In most common computer architectures, the resources that programs will make requests for will be the memory, the processor, and the storage. If you're familiar with the game “Mother May I”, the operating system acts very much like the player who plays “mother”.
